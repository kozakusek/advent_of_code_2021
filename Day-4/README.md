# --- Day 4: Giant Squid ---
## [Link](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/4)
You're already almost 1.5km (almost a mile) below the surface of the ocean, already so deep that you can't see any sunlight. What you can see, however, is a giant squid that has attached itself to the outside of your submarine.

Maybe it wants to play bingo?

## --- Part One ---
The score of the winning board can now be calculated. Start by finding the sum of all unmarked numbers on that board; in this case, the sum is 188. Then, multiply that sum by the number that was just called when the board won, 24, to get the final score, 188 * 24 = 4512.

To guarantee victory against the giant squid, figure out which board will win first. What will your final score be if you choose that board?

## --- Part Two ---
On the other hand, it might be wise to try a different strategy: let the giant squid win.

You aren't sure how many bingo boards a giant squid could play at once, so rather than waste time counting its arms, the safe thing to do is to figure out which board will win last and choose that one. That way, no matter which boards it picks, it will win for sure.

Figure out which board will win last. Once it wins, what would its final score be?

## Note
The day I lost. Seriously not in a mood for writing parsers in Haskell 4fun.  
Hence it is in python.  
And it is ugly.  
And slow.
